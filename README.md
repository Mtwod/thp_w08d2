# THP Project : Create a UI Kit

## Objectives

We have to create a UI Kit to use for our Eventbrite like website tomorrow. We choose a bootswatch theme (here : Flatly), then download it.

Then, we code each molecules of our website alongside organisms :
* Navbar
* Footer
* Forms
* Cards
* Cards list
* Comments
* Comments list with form
* Banners
* Landing pages

## How to use

Download / fork / clone this repository, open the 'index.html' file with your navigator, enjoy !
